# Biography of Mustafa Mahmoud

This a biography website about the Egyptian philosopher and doctor ["Mustafa Mahmoud"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Mahmoud).

This website contains information in the Arabic language about the Doctor. The information provided here is quoted from him or interpreted by me from his talks. He didn't write his life story or anything like that but he, instead, talked about his life on many occasions such interviews or talk shows that he was on.

## Website content

1. Landing page with a brief introduction and videos to hear and see him talking himself about himself and many other topics.

1. Gallery for all his work, books and novels, etc.

1. His life story from birth to death. I don't know every detail so everything I mentioned on that page is interpreted by me and quoted from him and his books.

1. A memorial page stating how he was remembered and honored after his death and a short note on why I decided to make this website.

(Disclaimer: everything works from right to left in the Arabic version of the website due to how the Arabic language works, including pages order. So the landing page is the one on the far right, not the far left.)

## The purpose of this website

The purpose of this website is to give some popularity about this philosopher which I admire a lot and share his values, and to spread his word both in the Arabic language reading world and (in the future) in the English language to cover worldwide. If you know the author or like his work and you think that his message carries a value that should be brought to the western world or given more light in the eastern world even, then see `How to contribute`.

## The future of the website
- Be hosted properly on the internet and have its own domain name.
-Have an English version of the website and perhaps other languages if I find contributors to help me translate, I only speak Arabic/English.
- I don't plan on having any commercial use for this website.
